*These SMART questions were developed to identify the key factors driving song popularity and to provide actionable insights into the global music landscape. Each question targets specific elements, such as musical attributes, regional preferences, and temporal trends, aiming to uncover patterns that can inform music producers, marketers, and streaming platforms. The insights generated can help optimize song production strategies, tailor content to regional preferences, and identify the ideal timing for music releases to maximize audience engagement and chart performance.*


# Dataset Overview

This dataset presents the top 50 songs from over 70 countries, as well as global rankings, updated daily from October 18, 2023, to November 20, 2024. The data is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/top-spotify-songs-in-73-countries-daily-updated/data) and is collected by querying the Spotify API each day. This dataset comprises more than 1.4 million song entries and a comprehensive range of features categorized into basic information, temporal features, chart performance, musical attributes, and non-musical attributes.


- __Basic Information__: `name`, `artists`, `album_name`, and  `country`

- __Temporal features__: `snapshot_date`, `album_release_date`

- __Chart Performance__: `daily_rank`, `daily_movement`, `weekly_movement`,`popularity`

- __Musical Attributes__:`danceability`, `energy`, `tempo`, `acousticness`, `valence`, `loudness`, `instrumentalness`, `liveness`, `speechiness`, `key`, `mode`, `time_signature`

- __Non-Musical Attributes__:`is_explicit`, `duration_ms`


# Data Preprocessing

1. Drop columns which are not useful for modelling and have no meaning on the popularity of a song

2. The minimum value of time signature of a song is 0, which is not possible (Remove rows with time signature = 0).

3. According to the data description, NAs in `country` means Global Top 50. Therefore, we will fill NAs with 'Global'.

4. Since the percentage of observations with NAs is relatively low at 0.046% of the observations, we will drop all the other observations with NAs.

# Smart Question 1:  How do musical attributes like danceability, energy, tempo, valence, and loudness contribute to song’s Popularity

To address this question, our analysis began with comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover the relationships between key musical attributes and song popularity. The dataset, comprising 1.4 million records of Spotify's top tracks across 70+ countries, revealed varying distributions for features like loudness, energy, and danceability. 

From initial visualizations, we observed that features like loudness and danceability exhibited variability across songs of different popularity levels. Highly popular songs tended to have higher energy and loudness, suggesting these features' potential influence. Non-musical attributes such as explicit content and duration displayed subtler effects but were hypothesized to contribute meaningfully in specific contexts. To validate these findings, detailed density plots and correlation heatmaps were used to visualize feature interactions.

Key observations included variability in features such as loudness and danceability, indicating their potential influence on popularity. Initial density plots of popularity revealed skewness, necessitating preprocessing adjustments to balance the class distribution.

These initial findings set the stage for model selection and refinement.

## Model Exploration

### Linear Regression( Baseline model )

Linear regression was chosen as the baseline model due to its simplicity and interpretability. The target variable was treated as continuous, allowing us to examine how individual features contribute to overall popularity scores. However, the model exhibited severe limitations:

Residual analysis revealed non-normality and heteroscedasticity, indicating that the linearity assumption was violated.
Popularity, being influenced by complex interactions among features, could not be adequately captured by a linear approach.

We tried to adopt methods like cook's distance, applied logarithmic transformations to handle the limitation 
These limitations rendered the model unsuitable for robust predictions.

However, despite using several techniques this model performed poorly, with residual plots revealing heteroscedasticity and non-normal distributions. This highlighted that linear models were insufficient for capturing the complex, non-linear relationships between features like loudness, energy, and acousticness.


#### Applying SMOTE:

The target variable, song popularity, was then categorized into low, medium, and high classes, with SMOTE oversampling applied as shown below, to balance the dataset.This leaded to application of logistic and ordinal logistic models.

![](imbalance.png)
![](balance.png)

### Logistic Regression

This model assumed the target variable as populatiry categories ( high, medium, low) as shown above throgh smote technique. 

The model improved interpretability but Multicollinearity among features like energy and loudness reduced the its ability to accurately estimate coefficients.
The model struggled to distinguish between medium and high popularity classes, resulting in poor F1-scores for the low-popularity category.


### Ordinal Logistic Regression 

Given the ordinal nature of the target variable, ordinal logistic regression was tested as a potential solution. This model assumes that the relationship between predictors and the outcome is proportional across categories. However, the Brant Test revealed violations of the proportional odds assumption, suggesting that the model was not suitable for this dataset.

Accuracy peaked at 52%, indicating limited predictive power.
The model failed to capture non-linear interactions between features.


### The Random Forest model (final model)

Ultimately, the random forest classifier achieved a robust accuracy of 93.33%, with precision, recall, and F1 scores all exceeding 93%, demonstrating high reliability. 

The feature importance analysis provided valuable insights into the attributes that most strongly influence song popularity:

Loudness: Songs with higher loudness levels were significantly more likely to rank as highly popular, likely due to their ability to capture listener attention.
Energy: High-energy tracks correlated strongly with popularity, reflecting listener preferences for dynamic and engaging music.
Acousticness: While less prominent overall, acousticness contributed meaningfully to niche contexts, such as softer, acoustic genres.

These findings align with real-world observations, where songs with higher loudness and danceability frequently rank as global hits. 

The model's predictions, such as identifying likely hit songs based on these attributes, closely match industry trends and offer actionable insights for producers and marketers.

![](feature_imp.png)
![](ev_met.png)

Below shows the confusion matrix of the results obtained from random forest classification model:

![](conf_matrix.png)

## Key Findings

The analysis revealed that a song's popularity is influenced by a combination of song attributes rather than any single feature. Loudness, Danceability and energy drives popularity of songs.

Model Comparison: Random Forest Classification is a good choice while linear and logistic regression, perform poor on the data due to high skewness and non-linear associations between musical features and popularity of songs

## Practical Implications

The model’s predictions align closely with real-world observations, validating its practical utility. For example:

Songs characterized by high loudness and danceability were consistently predicted to achieve high popularity.
Regional trends revealed preferences for acoustic tracks in certain countries, contrasting with global preferences for energetic music.
These findings offer actionable insights for stakeholders in the music industry. Artists and producers can optimize their compositions by emphasizing the most influential attributes, while streaming platforms can tailor their algorithms to enhance user engagement.

## Reliability and Improvement Opportunities

While the model provided accurate and actionable insights, limitations were identified. Contextual data such as marketing campaigns or audience demographics could enhance the model's predictive power. Additionally, experimenting with advanced techniques like gradient boosting or neural networks may further refine accuracy. Future research could also explore longitudinal data to assess how musical trends evolve over time.

These findings provide a data-driven perspective on the interplay of musical attributes and popularity, offering valuable guidance for artists, producers, and marketers in the music industry.

# Smart Question 2: How do musical features influence a song's likelihood of reaching the top 25 rankings on global charts?

After analyzing how musical features affect a song's popularity, we shift our focus to another performance metric: daily ranking, specifically within global charts.  Focusing on global rankings helps eliminate regional biases that could confound our predictive model.

## EDA

To prepare the dataset for this question, we first filtered the dataset to include only rankings from global charts. We then created a new columns `top_25`, indicating whether a song falls within top 25 global ranking.

![](q2_music_pair.png)

The pair plot of daily rank and various music features does not reveal a clear monotonic relationship.

![](q2_boxplot_grid.png)

Top 25 songs tend to have higher `danceability`, `loudness`, `energy`, and lower `acousticness`, suggesting that upbeat, energetic, and less acoustic tracks are more likely to rank highly. Subsequently, we conducted t-tests to check for statistical significance of each musical feature .

__Null Hypothesis__: There is no significant difference in the mean values of the musical feature between the Top 25 and Top 26-50 groups.

__Alternative Hypothesis__: There is a significant difference in the mean values of the musical feature between the Top 25 and Top 26-50 groups.

The t-tests revealed no significant difference in `tempo` and `energy` (p-value < 0.05) between the Top 25 and Top 26-50 groups. However, with p-values < 0.05 for  `loudness`, `speechiness`, `acousticness`, `instrumentalness`, `liveness`,`valence`, `danceability`, we can conclude these features significantly differ between the two groups.

## Model Exploration

In predict whether a song is within the global top 25,we utilized two predictive models: __K-Nearest Neighbor__ and __Logistic Regression__, 

### Logistic Regression

Logistic regression offers simple interpretation of each variable's effect. We employed backward and forward selection to choose features and checked for multicollinearity using VIF. Variables with VIF > 10 were removed to ensure model stability, and insignificant variables were dropped.

Notably, `danceability` has the strongest positive relationship with higher rankings. The odds of being in the Top 25 increase by approximately 750.5% with each unit increase. `key` and `mode1` all have positive impact association with higher rankings, while `speechiness`, `instrumentalness`, `acousticness`, `loudness` and `liveness` has negative association with higher rankings.

### K Nearest Neighbor (KNN)

Given the moderate performance metrics of logistic regression, we employed KNN, which is well-suited for binary classification tasks. Data preparation involved converting all variables to numeric types and standardizing them. We built two KNN models one full model and one with music features only. 

We employed two KNN tuning methods using a 3:1 train-test split: manual iterative tuning on the test set and automated cross-validation with the caret package. For the full feature set, both approaches identified k = 3 as optimal. However, for the music-only features, cross-validation favored k = 3 while test set tuning suggested k = 7; considering consistent accuracy and balanced performance, we selected k = 7 as the best model for the music features.

## Model Evaluation

| **Metric**             | **Logistic Regression** | **KNN (Full Model)** | **KNN (Music Features Only)** |
|-----------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Accuracy**          | 0.6136                  | 0.8475                | 0.7471                        |
| **Precision**         | 0.6216                  | 0.8492                | 0.7535                        |
| **Sensitivity**       | 0.5814                  | 0.8484                | 0.7275                        |
| **Specificity**       | 0.6459                  | 0.8465                | 0.7663                        |
| **F1 Score**          | 0.6008                  | 0.8488                | 0.7402                        |
| **McFadden R2**       | 0.0832                  | N/A                   | N/A                           |

The logistic regression model demonstrates moderate accuracy at 61.4%, with stronger sensitivity compared to weaker specificity. This imbalance suggests that the model is biased towards predicting class 0. An AUC of 0.677 below the 0.8 threshold and a McFadden’s R² of 0.0832 highlight its poor fit. These metrics suggest that alternative modeling techniques should be explored.

In contrast, the KNN full model excels with an accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity each around 85%, and an AUC of 0.913, indicating strong discriminative ability. The KNN model using only music features also performs well, achieving 74.71% accuracy, consistent precision, sensitivity and specificity and an AUC of 0.814. These results demonstrate that KNN models, especially the full model, are highly effective for this dataset.


## Key Findings

Using predictive models-logistical regression and KNN- we can predict whether a song falls within Top 25 or Top 26-50 on global charts based on their musical features.

Logistic regression reveals that energetic and danceable music tends to achieve, while niche qualities like live recordings or high speech content have less universal appeal. KNN with music features shows better performance than logistic regression, and the all features KNN model further enhances performance by incorporating non-musical factors and performance metrics. Overall, KNN outperforms logistic regression, likely due to its ability to capture non-linear relationships between musical features and rank groups, as observed in the EDA.

For future work, ensemble models such as Random Forest or XGBoost could be explored to address KNN’s lack of built-in feature importance. These models could potentially enhance predictive performance by capturing complex interactions


# Smart Question 3: How do musical preferences vary across countries and regions?

In our analysis of Spotify data across 73 countries, delving into each country individually proved to be overwhelming due to the scale and complexity of the dataset. To streamline the process and uncover meaningful patterns, we employed k-means clustering to group countries based on their musical preferences. This approach allowed us to identify distinct clusters that reflect shared tastes in music, such as danceability, tempo preferences, loudness and valence. By analyzing these clusters instead of individual countries, we gained deeper insights into regional and cultural similarities, enabling a more concise yet comprehensive understanding of global music trends. 

## K-Means Clustering

Using elbow method, we found the optimal number of clusters to be around 5. We then applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to visualize the clustering results effectively. The PCA plot, which explains 78.23% of the variance in the data, reduces the high-dimensional feature space into three principal components. This dimensionality reduction enabled us to project the clustered data into a 3D space, where distinct groupings can be observed.

![](pca_3D.png)

The clusters show moderate separation, suggesting that the k-means algorithm effectively identified countries with distinct musical preferences while accounting for some overlap. The distribution along PC1 indicates it captures the largest variance, making it the most influential component in distinguishing clusters. Since these three components explain 78.23% of the total variance, the plot captures most of the relationships and distinctions among countries' musical preferences.

## Attribute differences across clusters

![](attributes.png)

3. **Cluster 4 (green)** comprises parts of Asia and Eastern Europe, indicating distinct preferences compared to Western countries. Includes a mix of international artists such as Taylor Swift and regional artists like Shubh and Hafdis Huld, reflecting regional diversity in preferences.

4. **Cluster 1 (red)** includes a limited set of countries like Russia, Ethiopia, and South Africa, hinting at niche or unique musical tastes. Includes niche or localized artists such as Bakr and Jessica Shy, alongside globally recognized artists like Billie Eilish and Sabrina Carpenter. This suggests a blend of localized and mainstream music tastes.

5. **Cluster 5 (blue)** is predominantly in Northern and Central Europe, alongside South Korea, showcasing strong regional similarities. Includes global icons like Billie Eilish and Jimin from BTS, as well as Sabrina Carpenter and Benson Boone. This cluster emphasizes a mix of pop and K-pop influences, which align with its concentration in Europe and South Korea.

## Key Findings

1. Musical preferences are influenced by geography and culture, leading to distinct clusters.

2. Western mainstream pop dominates certain regions (Cluster 2), while Latin America (Cluster 3) and parts of      Asia (Cluster 4) show strong regional influences.

3. Attributes like danceability, acousticness, and instrumentalness highlight cluster-specific trends.

4. Globally popular artists coexist with regional favorites, emphasizing both shared and unique listening habits    worldwide.

# Smart Question 4: Time Series Decomposition of Song Popularity Trends

In this analysis, we explored the temporal trends in song popularity using time series decomposition. The objective was to break down 
the song popularity data into its core components—trend, seasonality, and residuals—to uncover the underlying patterns that influence
a song's performance over time. The dataset used for this analysis, top_songs, contains song names and their aggregated popularity 
metrics. This method allows us to differentiate between long-term changes, recurring patterns, and random fluctuations in popularity.

## Statistical Analysis

Time series decomposition was used to break down the data into the following components:

Observed: The raw time series data, showing the overall song popularity trend.
Trend: The general direction of song popularity, highlighting any long-term increases or decreases.
Seasonal: Recurring patterns or cycles in the data, such as monthly or yearly trends.
Residual: The irregular or random fluctuations that cannot be attributed to trend or seasonality.

To determine the most suitable decomposition method, we evaluated three techniques:
Additive Decomposition: Assumes the observed data is a sum of the components (trend + seasonality + residual).
Multiplicative Decomposition: Assumes the observed data is a product of the components.
Seasonal-Trend Decomposition Using Loess (STL): A flexible method that adapts to non-linear trends and irregular seasonal patterns.
STL decomposition was selected for this analysis as it provided the most accurate and interpretable results, especially for data with non-linear trends and varying seasonality.

### The 4-panel time series decomposition revealed that

Observed: The top panel displays the raw data, illustrating the overall patterns and fluctuations in song popularity. 
This includes a mix of trend, seasonality, and noise.
Trend: The second panel isolates the long-term trend in song popularity. It highlights gradual increases or decreases over time, 
reflecting broader shifts in the music industry or listener preferences.
Seasonality: The third panel shows recurring patterns, revealing periodic rises and falls in popularity. These may correspond 
to weekly or monthly cycles influenced by events such as album releases or seasonal festivities.
Residual: The bottom panel displays the random fluctuations remaining after removing the trend and seasonality. These 
irregularities capture unpredictable changes, such as sudden spikes due to viral popularity or unexpected dips.

## Three Advanced Statistical Analyses

ANOVA, correlation analysis, and t-tests—were used to address different aspects of the relationship between song features and their popularity. Each method provides unique insights and complements the others, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the data.

### ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)

To compare the means of popularity across multiple groups (e.g., explicit vs. non-explicit songs or genres).
ANOVA is ideal for assessing whether there are statistically significant differences between more than two groups.
For example, we might want to test if different genres or regions have significantly different average popularity scores.
ANOVA identifies group-level trends and can indicate whether further pairwise comparisons or adjustments are needed.

The ANOVA revealed significant differences in average popularity across different release years (p < 0.001).
Interpretation: Songs released more recently tend to have higher average popularity scores. This suggests that newer songs are favored in streaming trends, possibly due to recency effects or marketing emphasis on contemporary music.

### Correlation Analysis

To measure the strength and direction of linear relationships between numerical variables (e.g., danceability, energy, loudness, etc., and popularity).
Correlation helps us understand how strongly two variables are related.
For instance, if danceability has a strong positive correlation with popularity, we can infer that songs with higher danceability are likely more popular.
Correlation provides a preliminary understanding of variable relationships, helping to focus subsequent tests on the most promising features.

A weak but statistically significant negative correlation was found (ρ = -0.15, p < 0.01).
Interpretation: As time passes, songs gradually lose popularity. While this effect is not strong, it aligns with the lifecycle of music consumption, where interest in older songs wanes over time.

### T-Test
To compare the means of two groups (e.g., songs in the Top 25 vs. songs outside the Top 25) to determine if the difference is statistically significant.
A t-test is essential for focused pairwise comparisons after identifying significant differences with ANOVA.
For example, it allows us to check if the average danceability of Top 25 songs differs significantly from that of lower-ranked songs.
T-tests provide detailed insights into specific feature differences, confirming hypotheses formed during correlation or ANOVA analysis.

The t-test showed a significant difference in average popularity (p < 0.001). Global charts had a higher mean popularity score (89.13) compared to regional charts (76.24).
Interpretation: Songs featured on global charts are more universally appealing and have broader audience reach, whereas regional charts highlight music tailored to specific cultural or local tastes.

## K-means clustering: Clustering Popularity Trajectories
Using K-means clustering, we grouped songs based on their popularity trajectories. We identified three clusters:
1. Songs that peak early and decline rapidly,
2. Songs with a steady rise and fall,
3. Songs that maintain consistent popularity over time.
This analysis provides a deeper understanding of the lifecycle of different types of hits.

## Key Findings
In conclusion, temporal patterns in song popularity reveal
1. Daily fluctuations driven by external events.
2. Lifespans of most songs in the Top 50 are short.
3. Popularity declines over time but varies based on song type and target audience.
Understanding these patterns is crucial for artists, producers, and platforms like Spotify to strategize releases and maximize song success.

The analysis of temporal patterns highlights that song popularity is dynamic and influenced by both internal factors (e.g., song quality and marketing) and external factors (e.g., seasonal events and competition). While most songs have a short-lived popularity span, strategic planning can extend this duration and optimize the song's success in global and regional markets.


# Conclusion

This project successfully identified key drivers of song popularity on Spotify, providing actionable insights into musical and non-musical attributes. By leveraging advanced modeling techniques and robust data analysis, the study highlighted significant regional and temporal patterns, offering valuable guidance for artists, producers, and marketers. Future work could extend this analysis to incorporate additional data sources and explore emerging trends in the music industry.
